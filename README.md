# Serials Box

### Description
Serials box is an online service for information related to television series - including cast,
crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, and where users can leave comments and write articles about the series.
### Features
Series pages and the blog are available to all users, but only registered and logged in users can leave comments on the series and add new articles to the blog. Registered users can add series to their favorites and like articles.

Each registered user has access to a personal account, where he can change his username, add an avatar, write information about himself and set his date of birth.
On the profile page, the user has access to articles they like, favorite series, and adding an article. The article can be deleted and edited only by the author of the article and the admin.

User profile pages show a user's registration date and username and, optionally, their avatar, bio and age.
